# AirBnB in New Tab

I coffeescript onliner that opens airbnb links from the /search page in new tabs instead of messing up your search.

## Features I might add

- Make the map resizable
- Make links to the properties in the map scroll down to the correct number in the search list rather than going directly to the listing page
- Put price inside pin on map
